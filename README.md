MailCrew, a simple, modular project that demonstrates how easy it is to get started with AI agent concepts.

**Hereâ€™s a quick summary of what I built:**

âœ… Developed an AI Email Assistant called MailCrew that can:

Summarize an email

Analyze Sentiment of the email

Generate a smart reply to the email

âœ… Built using open-source models like FLAN-T5 (for summarization,
sentiment analysis, and reply generation).

âœ… Created a simple Streamlit UI where users can paste email content
and get instant outputs.

âœ… Each feature is handled by a simple agent function (no orchestration
yet â€” agents are run independently).

âœ… Designed for easy extension â€” users can swap out the model in the
agent files (agent_summarization.py, agent_sentiment.py,
agent_reply.py) if they want to customize.

âœ… Virtual environment setup and requirements.txt are provided to make
it simple to deploy locally or to the cloud (e.g., AWS).

âœ… Project is fully open-sourced on GitHub! ðŸŽ‰
If you'd like to try it out or learn how to work with CrewAI or
open-source HuggingFace models, feel free to fork the project and
experiment.

**Tech Stack:**

Python 3

Streamlit for UI

Simple agent design using CrewAI

HuggingFace Transformers (FLAN-T5 model)

VSCode for development

I'm excited about how lightweight tools like CrewAI and open models 
like FLAN-T5 can empower quick innovations.
